## Project Overview

## Project Structure

### Agent Behavior
- At the beginning of the conversation, the Agent will say "Aye aye Sir!!!"
- Before starting a task, if it has multiple steps, let's create a todo list of the steps.
- The last step of the todo list should be to run the build: make build
- At the end of an implementation or some changes always ask if we should commit the changes. Do so if the answer is yes.
